 * PRD-25 FR-03: the home page is ONE page rendered in one of two shells. A
 * profile holding any author- or manager-side capability gets the author shell
 * with the sidebar; a pure learner stays in the learner shell.
 *
 * Rebuilding the learner area around the sidebar would be architecturally
 * cleaner, but it is out of this PRD's scope and needs its own wireframes
 * (decision D-5) — so the shell is picked here rather than unified.
