/**
 * @module features/tests/editor/sections/template-thumb
 * @description The template thumbnail shown on the design tab's template card and
 * on every card of the «Заменить шаблон» gallery.
 *
 * It renders the template's OWN preview image — `manifest.assets.preview`, the same
 * asset the PRD-3 admin registry shows — served by
 * `GET /api/templates/:id/assets/*` (any signed-in user; see
 * {@link module:server/routes/templates}). Both call sites previously drew a
 * hand-built sketch of coloured `div`s ported from the wireframe, so every template
 * looked identical no matter what was imported.
 *
 * The sketch survives as the FALLBACK, passed in as children: a template may declare
 * no `assets.preview`, and a package installed before the validator required one may
 * declare a file that is no longer there. The second case only surfaces when the
 * request fails, so the fallback also covers a load error at runtime.
