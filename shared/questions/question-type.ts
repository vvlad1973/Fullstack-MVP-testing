/**
 * @module shared/questions/question-type
 *
 * The SINGLE source of question-type traits. Answer handling branches on the question
 * type in roughly forty places across the server, the web host, the SCORM runtime and
 * the author UI, and those branches are NOT exhaustive `switch`es — they are chains of
 * `if (type === '...')` falling through to a default. Adding a type therefore compiles
 * cleanly while silently skipping logic (PRD-26 risk R-1).
 *
 * The fix is to branch on a TRAIT instead of on a literal: a new type declares its
 * traits here once, and every consumer keeps working. Consumers that ask
 * «is this answered by one index?» use {@link isSingleIndexChoice} rather than
 * `type === "single"`.
 *
 * Pure and framework-free — safe to bundle into the SCORM runtime. The in-package
 * runtime mirrors these predicates in `server/scorm/template/app/utils/qtype.js`
 * (plain ES5, no imports available there); the two MUST stay in sync, and the mirror
 * carries a pointer back to this module.
