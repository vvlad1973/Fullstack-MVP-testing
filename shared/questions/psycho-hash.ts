/**
 * @module shared/questions/psycho-hash
 *
 * PRD-66 FR-09a: the fingerprint of a question's CONTENT, used to split observations
 * into series. Editing a question makes the answers given before and after it
 * psychometrically different items: difficulty and discrimination collected on the old
 * wording say nothing about the new one. Statistics are therefore aggregated by this
 * fingerprint frozen at answer time, never by the (possibly already edited) row.
 *
 * NOT the same thing as `questions.content_hash`, and deliberately a separate column.
 * That one is compared by PRD-15 — `test_question_scoring.pinned_content_hash` pins a
 * per-test price to a revision — so changing how it is computed would mark every price
 * override stale at once. Different purposes, different fields.
 *
 * What the fingerprint covers: type, prompt, options/pairs and the correct answer. What
 * it deliberately does NOT cover:
 *
 * - price and partial-credit rules (BRD PA-15d) — since migration 028 scoring belongs to
 *   the TEST, so at the moment a question is saved there is nothing to hash; the grading
 *   rule is the second element of the series key instead;
 * - the ORDER of answer options (PA-15b) — a reshuffle that keeps the same correct answer
 *   is the same instrument, and breaking the series over it would throw away data.
 *   Positional distractor analysis is out of scope for the CTT iteration.
 *
 * Pure and framework-free: the same function serves the server, the web host and the
 * import pipeline, so one question yields one fingerprint everywhere.
