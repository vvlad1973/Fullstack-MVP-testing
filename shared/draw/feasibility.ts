/**
 * @module shared/draw/feasibility
 *
 * Pure draw-feasibility core (PRD-15 block A, FR-04; BRD BRC-15; audit matrix
 * E-1..E-13). Given a topic's question pool AS IT WOULD BE AFTER a proposed
 * mutation (deletion, re-tagging, difficulty change, move) and the draw
 * requirements of every dependent test, it reports per-test issues:
 *
 * - `pool_shortfall`        — fewer questions than the section `drawCount` (E-1);
 * - `quota_shortfall`       — a blueprint stratum cannot be filled (E-3);
 * - `adaptive_shortfall`    — an adaptive level loses its minimum pool (E-4);
 * - `measurement_loss`      — removed questions carry scale contributions in
 *                             this test (E-5, the `question_measurements`
 *                             cascade);
 * - `variant_incomplete`    — a fixed variant of the section references questions
 *                             that left the pool, so it can no longer be delivered
 *                             whole (PRD-17 FR-10/BR-12-06);
 * - `draw_all_shrink`       — a `drawAll` section silently gets shorter (E-9;
 *                             advisory even for published tests).
 *
 * Blueprint feasibility is checked by SIMULATING the real draw
 * (`drawSection` with a deterministic shuffle), so the verdict is exactly as
 * strict as the runtime selection — same greedy stratum order, same shared
 * `used` set, same exact/min fill rules.
 *
 * The module is policy-free: it does not decide what blocks and what warns.
 * The caller (server/services/draw-feasibility, plan T-07) maps issues to the
 * PRD-15 policy — published dependents block with `409`, drafts warn —
 * except `draw_all_shrink`, which is always advisory (`advisory: true`).
 *
 * Per-test difficulty overrides (block D, FR-34) are applied per dependent
 * test, because the EFFECTIVE difficulty of the same question differs between
 * tests.
