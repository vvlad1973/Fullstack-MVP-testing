/**
 * @module shared/answer-check/rules
 *
 * The SET of comparison rules an open answer is checked against (PRD-57 §6.1) — the
 * single engine behind the short answer (§6.5) and, from Э8 on, every blank (FR-24c).
 *
 * Shape decisions, all taken by the owner on 2026-09-18 and recorded as requirements:
 * the answer KIND is a property of the question, not of a rule (FR-28d) — text and
 * number never stand side by side, because a rule of the other kind could not fire once;
 * the JOIN is one per set (FR-28c) — mixing «и» with «или» would need brackets, and
 * brackets turn a list into an expression builder the track walks away from.
 *
 * An EMPTY set is not an error: it means the author has not written the check yet. It
 * matches nothing, and {@link hasRules} is what callers ask before treating the question
 * as graded at all — the same way a keyless scale is measurement-only.
 *
 * `match: "regex"` runs since Э7, and it never runs UNBUDGETED where a budget is possible:
 * a host that owns a killable executor (the server's worker thread, the package's web
 * worker) checks the expressions first and passes the results in as `verdicts`, so this
 * module stays synchronous and identical on both hosts (FR-28q, FR-28s).
 *
 * Pure and framework-free — safe to bundle into the SCORM runtime.
