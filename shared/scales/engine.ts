/**
 * @module shared/scales/engine
 *
 * Pure scale-computation core (PRD-5, B5). Given a test's scale configs, the
 * per-question measurement contributions and the learner's answers, it produces
 * the `scale.*` namespace (one {@link ScaleResult} per scale key) consumed by the
 * SCORM runtime and by the server-side preview/validate endpoints. It is the
 * authoritative implementation; a plain-JS twin
 * (server/scorm/template/app/scales/engine.js) runs in the package and is kept in
 * parity by a golden test.
 *
 * Pipeline per scale (scoring-model §10): select active contributions for the
 * learner's answer -> aggregate (sum/avg/weighted_avg/max/min) into `raw` ->
 * normalize (`none` keeps raw; `percent` maps to 0..100, inverted when
 * `direction = inverse`) -> apply interpretation bands to the *raw* value to
 * derive `level`/`label`.
 *
 * Stage-1 unit identity is index-based (the answer pipeline has no stable option
 * ids): `source_key` is the option index ("2"), the matching pair ("left:right")
 * or the ranking placement ("item:pos"); `source_type = "question"` contributes
 * whenever the question is answered.

 * the reference questionnaire the naive figure is 392 per style where the method's own note
 * says 98, and since this domain is what percent normalization and the PRD-29 band ruler
 * both read, the error would move the VERDICT rather than a number.
 *
 * The exact bounds come from a small optimisation. Let `n` be this scale's statements inside
 * the question and `N` all of them. The scale's statements hold a total `S` bounded by
 *
 *   `S >= max(n * min, budget - (N - n) * max)`   — the others cannot absorb everything
 *   `S <= min(n * max, budget - (N - n) * min)`   — nor can these exceed the budget

 * and each statement lies in `[min, max]`. Maximising a linear objective over that box is
 * pure greed: start every statement at `min`, then pour the free pool into the largest
 * coefficient first, capped at `max - min` per statement. The lower bound is the mirror
 * image. With equal coefficients — the ordinary case, and the reference's — this reduces to
 * «the budget, capped by what this scale's statements can hold».
