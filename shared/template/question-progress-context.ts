/**
 * @module shared/template/question-progress-context
 *
 * PRD-19 Block C — the single builder that turns the runtime question statuses
 * into the Core-prepared progress-pills map ({@link CtxQuestionsProgress}). BOTH
 * hosts call it so the pills render identically (parity, PRD-12): the SCORM
 * runtime feeds `state.questionStatuses` + `state.flatQuestions`; the web host
 * feeds its `questionStatus` map + `flatQuestions`. The DSL only interpolates the
 * `statusClass` / `ariaLabel` / `clickable` this prepares — no logic in the layout.
 *
 * Scope (FR-11): sectional flows show only the CURRENT section's questions; the
 * flat flow spans the whole test. Frontier: already-issued questions — reached
 * (`index <= currentIndex`) OR already answered/skipped — of a not-yet-committed
 * section are clickable jump targets; genuinely future and frozen ones are not.
 *
 * Pure — no DOM, no host globals — unit-testable and safe to bundle for both hosts.
