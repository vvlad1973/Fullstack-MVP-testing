/**
 * @module shared/template/short-answer-dom
 *
 * Wires the typed-answer field (PRD-57 §6.5) to its host, on BOTH hosts — the web
 * question screen and the in-package renderer (PRD-12 FR-30).
 *
 * Interaction everywhere else in the unified renderer is delegated through a click on
 * `data-action`, but a text field is different in kind: the answer changes on every
 * keystroke, not on a choice, so the field is subscribed to directly. The contract
 * mirrors {@link module:shared/template/allocation-dom} — the host supplies the
 * accessors, this module returns the unsubscribe function.
 *
 * The RAW string is handed over, untrimmed: what the learner typed is what travels to
 * the LMS report and to the attempt review, and folding it would show them something
 * they did not write. Normalisation belongs to the comparison alone
 * ({@link module:shared/answer-check/normalize}).
