/**
 * @module shared/template/scene-timers
 *
 * The scene's countdown displays — ONE renderer for both hosts.
 *
 * Every flow layout ships two DS timers in the header (`#timer-display` for the
 * test limit, `#section-timer-display` for the section one), hidden behind
 * `q-timer--hidden`. The SCORM runtime reveals and paints them as the countdown
 * runs; the web host did not, and instead appended «· Время темы 9:51» to the
 * question counter — so the same test showed a DS timer chip in the package and a
 * grey run-on text on the web (PRD-12 parity defect, 2026-07-29).
 *
 * DOM-based but framework-free, exactly like `fit-question`: the package calls it
 * after mounting a screen, the web host from its render effect, and `root` is the
 * document in one case and the shadow tree in the other.
