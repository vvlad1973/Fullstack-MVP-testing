 * WE ARE SILENT ONLY WHERE WE ARE SURE OF SUCCESS. The rule is deliberately NOT «show on
 * failure»: per-topic thresholds are the exception in a standard test, so most topics
 * carry no verdict at all (`passed === null`) — treating «nothing was judged» as success

 * `notPassed` as a parameter rather than a second copy of this function per mode. The
 * standard mode reads the topic's pass verdict (`passed !== true`, so both an explicit
 * failure and an absent verdict speak). The adaptive mode has no third state: there the

   * `TEST_DATA.overallPassRule`. Where both are present they agree — they are read off

   * the feedback gate (unknown keeps handing the learner everything the author wrote —
   * losing a leaflet is worse than showing it once too often) and the verdict tag
   * (unknown keeps the «Пройден»/«Не пройден» headline, so a host that has not been
   * taught to send the flag does not lose the verdict of every graded test it renders).
   * The flag therefore only ever silences; it never invents a verdict or a leaflet.
   *
   * `false` is NOT the same as absent: it is the author's own «this test has no
