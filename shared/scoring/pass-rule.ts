/**
 * @module shared/scoring/pass-rule
 * @description Single source of pass-rule resolution + evaluation for BOTH hosts
 * (the web grader and the SCORM package runtime), PRD-18 unification. Topic rules
 * are authored as the editor `{source}` union; the overall rule as `{type,value}`.
 * This normalises EVERY shape to one runtime rule `{type:'percent'|'count', value}`
 * (or `null` = no gate) and applies the PRD-10 FR-10 basis: a `percent` rule
 * compares the points-based percent, a `count` rule compares Σ EARNED POINTS (NOT
 * the fully-correct question count).
 *
 * Replaces the two divergent inline implementations — `checkPassRuleWithPartial`
 * (resultsPage.js, Σ-points basis, no source handling) and the inline cast in
 * attempts.ts (correct-COUNT basis, no source handling) — both of which mis-graded
 * `inherit_overall` / `none` (treated as an unsatisfiable `value:undefined` count
 * rule, so the topic always failed) and disagreed on the count basis.
 *
 * PRD-50 added a second half of the topic gate here — the thresholds of the section's
 * breakdown keys. It is GONE (решение владельца 2026-09-03), and §16 removed the stored
 * thresholds themselves: the порог подтемы is derived from the topic's own rule, so
 * nothing about keys is resolved here any more.
