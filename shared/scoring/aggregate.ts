/**
 * @module shared/scoring/aggregate
 * @description THE single standard result-aggregation algorithm (PRD-18). ONE
 * implementation consumed by BOTH the web grader (`server/routes/attempts.ts`) and
 * the SCORM package runtime (`resultsPage.js calculateResults`, via the `TBTemplate`
 * IIFE bundle). Per-question scoring delegates to {@link scoreAnswer}; pass-rule
 * resolution/eval to `./pass-rule`. The function is PURE and ROUNDING-FREE — each
 * host rounds only at render / LMS emission. Adaptive aggregation (level coverage)
 * is a separate engine.
 *
 * Behaviour (faithful to the prior SCORM `calculateResults`, with the pass-rule
 * bug fixed): per-question `ratio = scoreAnswer(...).ratio` (0 for unanswered);
 * `earned += points*ratio`, `possible += points`, `correct++` only on `ratio===1`
 * (partial credit does NOT count as correct); per-topic + overall percent are
 * points-based; the final verdict combines the overall rule with the topic gates
 * per the authored `passDecisionPolicy` (see {@link decideVerdict}) — data written
 * before that policy existed keeps the old `overallPassed && every gated topic`.
 *
 * PRD-50: this is also the SOLE entry point into `shared/breakdown/` — every
 * delivered, graded question is fed to {@link computeBreakdowns} here, so the
 * per-topic (`AggregateTopicResult.breakdown`) and per-test (`AggregateResult.breakdowns`)
 * records are computed once, in this one place, for both hosts. They are purely
 * additive: absent `axisKeys` never affects `earned`/`possible`/the verdict above.

// (semantically correct, the reference behaviour) but threw, unguarded, out of range.
