 *
 * The column is authored JSON: it may hold a mode this build does not know, may
 * miss the router fields entirely, and carries the router's gating
 * (`routerCompletionPolicy`, `sectionUnlockRules`) next to modes that have no
 * router at all. Turning that into the shape a runtime can act on is a decision —
 * which mode to fall back to, what an absent completion policy means, whether the
 * router fields travel outside router mode — and while each host made that decision
 * for itself they disagreed: the SCORM bake clamped the mode and shipped the gating,
 * the web attempt payload passed the raw mode through and shipped NOTHING, so a
 * section locked by a prerequisite in the LMS was open on the web, and «Завершить»
 * under `all_required_passed` unlocked on the web as soon as the sections were
 * merely finished.
 *
 * Framework-free and browser-safe, like the rest of `shared/flow`.

 * The router fields are resolved ONLY in router mode — elsewhere they describe a
