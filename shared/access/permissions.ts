/**
 * @module shared/access/permissions
 *
 * The role -> permission map and the permission-check helpers (PRD-13). A user's
 * effective permissions are the union of the permission sets of all roles in
 * their set, plus everything if `superadmin` is present. This module is pure: it
 * decides whether a role set holds a capability "in principle". Object-level
 * scope (test ownership and grants) is enforced separately by the test-access
 * service.
 *
 * Invariant: `administrator` holds every capability except the
 * superadmin-only ones ({@link SUPERADMIN_ONLY}); `superadmin` holds all. The
 * author and manager sets are listed explicitly; `developer` is the author set
 * plus SCORM generation.
 *
 * Normative source: docs/specs/access-control/role-model.md (sections 3-4).
