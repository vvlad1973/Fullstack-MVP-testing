/**
 * @module server/storage/test-transfer-repository
 *
 * Writes an imported test graph in ONE transaction.
 *
 * Rows are inserted WHOLE, not field by field. Every other writer in the codebase spells
 * out the columns it sets, and that is precisely the habit that loses a newly added column
 * — the workbook lost half a test that way. Here the plan already holds rows shaped like
 * the table, so they go in as they are; a column added tomorrow travels because nobody has
 * to remember it. Only what belongs to the INSTALLATION is stripped: the timestamps, which
 * the database owns.
 *
 * A column present in the package but absent from this database raises — loudly, and with
 * the whole transaction rolled back. That is the intended answer to importing a package
 * written by a NEWER application: refuse, rather than store a test with a piece missing.
