/**
 * @module server/services/assignment-link
 *
 * Single choke point for issuing — or withholding — a passwordless assignment
 * link and sending the notification e-mail that goes with it. Every place
 * that used to mint a magic link by hand now calls {@link deliverAssignmentLink}
 * instead: direct and group assignment creation, the three "resend" endpoints
 * (`server/routes/assignments.ts`), and adding a user to a group that already
 * has an active assignment (`server/routes/groups.ts`).
 *
 * This module exists because of D-3 (PLAN_MAGIC_LINK_SCOPE.md, Этап 3): a
 * recipient holding any role other than `learner` must never receive a
 * password-free entry link. Before this module existed, the
 * check-then-mint-or-withhold logic was duplicated by hand at every call site,
 * and one site (`server/routes/groups.ts`) was missed entirely because it
 * never imported the helper it should have consulted. Centralizing the
 * decision here means a future sixth call site gets the gate "for free" by
 * construction, rather than by remembering to copy it correctly again.

 * A withheld recipient is normal operation, not an error: logged as info,
 * never thrown. Callers only need to resolve the recipient and their e-mail
 * beforehand (decrypt errors are handled by the caller, since the desired
 * response — 400, skip, silent return — differs by call site).
 *
 * The result reports what happened per recipient: whether a link was issued,
 * the link itself (see {@link DeliverAssignmentLinkResult.magicLink}) and
 * whether the transport accepted the letter, so a bulk run can tally failures
 * and offer the operator a one-time export of the links it just minted.
