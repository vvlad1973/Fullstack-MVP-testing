/**
 * Build the adaptive results-screen context (level-based). No SCORM action flags —
 * the web adaptive results screen shows the base "Пройти снова" action.
 *
 * @param measures The material of the results screen, as the route reads it for BOTH
 *   modes — the test's own feedback block AND its measurement rows. Both are properties
 *   of the TEST rather than of its flow mode, so both reach this screen (issue #33): the
 *   feedback as the widest source of the consolidated recommendations block, the rows as
 *   the «Ваш результат» / «По шкалам» blocks. The measured VALUES come from the SAVED
 *   adaptive result (`scaleResults` / `resultVariables`, filled in by
 *   `completeMeasuresSource`) and are never recomputed here. Absent (material unreadable)
 *   simply leaves both out, exactly as it does on the standard screen.
