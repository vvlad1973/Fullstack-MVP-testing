/**
 * @module scripts/dev/findings-registry
 * @description Turns the markdown finding tables of the drawer acceptance report into a
 * machine-readable registry, and assigns each finding to a fix batch.
 *
 * Why this exists. The 2026-09-04 acceptance of the test-editor drawer against the approved
 * wireframe produced 221 table rows across seven sections of one report. Re-typing those ids
 * into a plan or a checklist is exactly the transcription step that loses items, and a lost
 * finding is indistinguishable from a fixed one — which is how the previous acceptance
 * managed to record two sections as delivered while they existed only in code comments.
 * Generating the registry keeps a single source of truth: the report is written once, every
 * batch of fixes is a query over this JSON, and the closing gate asserts that every id has an
 * outcome.
 *
 * Usage: `tsx scripts/dev/findings-registry.ts` — rewrites the JSON next to the report.
