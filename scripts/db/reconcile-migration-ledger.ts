/**
 * @module scripts/db/reconcile-migration-ledger
 *
 * Deploy-time repair step: realign the timestamps in `drizzle.__drizzle_migrations`
 * with `drizzle/meta/_journal.json` so `drizzle-kit migrate` does not try to apply a
 * migration that is already in the database.
 *
 * WHY this exists. `migrate` decides what to apply by TIME, not by hash: it takes
 * `MAX(created_at)` from the ledger and runs every journal entry whose `when` is
 * greater. So a migration that was REGENERATED or rebased after it had already been
 * applied gets a new `when`, lands «in the future» relative to the ledger, and is
 * applied a second time — failing with `column ... already exists` and aborting the
 * release BEFORE the migrations that actually matter. The drift lives in the
 * DATABASE, so every instance carries its own copy of the problem.
 *
 * That is exactly what happened with `0018_prd28_external_participant` (regenerated
 * during PRD-28): dev could not apply the PRD-50 migrations until its ledger row was
 * realigned by hand. Doing that by hand on every stand is not a deploy — hence this
 * script.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES, precisely: for every ledger row whose HASH matches a migration file
 * in the journal, it sets `created_at` to that entry's `when`. Nothing else.
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO: it never INSERTS a row. Marking an unapplied
 * migration as applied would silently skip real DDL — the opposite failure, and a
 * much worse one. A migration that is genuinely missing from the ledger stays
 * missing, and `migrate` applies it as it should.
 *
 * Idempotent: a second run finds nothing to fix and reports 0.
 *
 * Usage (inside the production image, as the deploy does it):
 *   node dist/reconcile-migration-ledger.cjs [--dry-run]
